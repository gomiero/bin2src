# TODO List

### Important

- [ ] generate and document all examples folders
- [ ] document all the code
- [ ] revise the (very much likely) mistakes with English language in all codebase and comments
- [ ] optimize routines
- [ ] make tests on Linux and Raspbian
 
### Not so important

- [ ] implement new languages
- [ ] review and reformat all the text files
 

### Maybe...

- [ ] implement a 'plugin interface' like for new languages
- [ ] implement a simple "array compressor" (RLE?)
